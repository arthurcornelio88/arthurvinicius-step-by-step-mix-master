# Step-by-Step Mix & Master (Atmospheric Pop)

A technical documentation of the mixing and mastering process for "Step-by-Step," focusing on frequency slotting, spatial "atmosphere" creation, and analog-style tape mastering.

## 1. Technical Targets
* **Final Integrated Loudness:** -12.4 LUFS-I
* **True Peak Max:** -1.0 dB
* **Dynamic Range (LRA):** 9.1 LU

## 2. Core Mixing Strategy
* **Low-End Management:** 80Hz "pocket" cut on the Bassline to allow the MPC Beat (Kick) to punch through.
* **Atmosphere Bus:** Centralized FX bus using Voxengo OldSkoolVerb with 50ms pre-delay and "Dry Mute" active to prevent phase smearing.
* **Vocal Polish:** Multi-stage processing using RX 11 (De-esser), ReaEQ (Air boost), and ReaComp (3:1 ratio).

## 3. Mastering Chain (The Legacy Chain)
1. **FerricTDS mkII:** Analog tape dynamics and high-frequency saturation (35% Saturation, Fast Recovery).
2. **TDR Nova:** Surgical tonal balance and dynamic EQ.
3. **LoudMax:** Final limiting with -18.0 Threshold and -1.0 Output ceiling.
4. **Youlean Loudness Meter 2:** Final analytical verification.
