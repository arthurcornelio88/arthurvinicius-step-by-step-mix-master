# Project: step-by-step (Refactored)
## Rapid Mix & Master Documentation

### 1. Project Overview
* **Artist:** Arthur Vinicius
* **Genre:** Atmospheric Pop
* **Goal:** High-efficiency mix focusing on atmosphere, vocal presence, and guitar integration.

### 2. Instrumentation & Input State
| Track Name | Source | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Beat** | MPC Beats | Consolidated WAV (Kick, Snare, Hats). |
| **Bassline** | MPC Beats | Solid low-end foundation. |
| **Rhodes** | MPC Beats | Native MPC FX applied (Atmospheric). |
| **Synth** | MPC Beats | Native MPC FX applied. |
| **Guitar** | Live | Direct Input / Guitar Rig. |
| **Voice** | Live | Best takes from "Voz Boa" 1 & 2. |

### 3. Mixing Strategy (Rapid Mix)
* **Frequency Slotting:** Instead of sidechaining, use EQ to carve a hole in the **Bassline** for the **Beat's** kick (around 60Hz-100Hz).
* **Atmospheric Glue:** Use **Voxengo OldSkoolVerb** as a shared bus to place the "dry" live elements (Guitar/Voice) in the same space as the MPC instruments.
* **Vocal Focus:** Prioritize iZotope processing to ensure the voice sits "above" the dense MPC layers.

### 4. Technical Constraints
* **MPC FX:** Native effects on Rhodes/Synth are "baked-in." Processing will be additive/corrective rather than transformative.
